I adapted the UNet model definition to Keras library functions using this source's code: https://www.machinelearningnuggets.com/image-segmentation-with-u-net-define-u-net-model-from-scratch-in-keras-and-tensorflow/

This is the original UNet paper, in which it was proposed for use in biomedical image segmentation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf?ref=machinelearningnuggets.com
